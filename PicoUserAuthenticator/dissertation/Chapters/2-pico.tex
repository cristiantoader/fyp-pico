The project has strong connections with the Pico project. Therefore, the following sections aim to go into brief detail as to what Pico is, how it works, and what its properties are. T

In the paper ``Pico: no more passwords!'' \cite{stajano2011pico}, Frank Stajano describes an alternative design to passwords. It is based on a hardware token called ``Pico'', which replaces all instances where passwords could be used. The reason for designing this alternative authentication mechanism is that passwords are not as usable and secure as they used to be. 

Computation power has increased significantly since passwords became popular. This makes passwords easier to break using either brute-force or dictionary attacks. As a result, restrictions were imposed to make passwords stronger, such as requiring at least an upper case letter or a numeric character. Furthermore, in order to reduce the threat of dictionary attacks, authentications systems recommend, if not enforce, passwords to be harder to guess, meaning they should not contain dictionary words. Furthermore, after imposing all these restrictions, it is also recommended to change them regularly. This rule is sometimes enforced in the case of larger companies.

The changes previously described are reasonable from a security point of view, but completely lack user focus. With an increasing number accounts requiring authentication, whether web based or local, passwords become increasingly difficult to remember. Reusing them is not recommended, as compromising one account would lead to multi-account exposure. This leads to having users remember a large number of unique passwords, which is not realistic in practice. Therefore security compromises are made by the user such as writing passwords down, or reusing them, therefore breaking the theoretical security of the password.

The token based alternative designed by Frank Stajano improves the security offered by passwords. It transforms something you know in something you have. This makes the authentication memory effortless. Unlike other hardware tokens, Pico is theft resistant thanks to small devices called Picosiblings. The Pico uses wireless communication with the Picosiblings and becomes unlocked only in their presence. It is also responsible for generating authentication credentials therefore ensuring that they are not weak or reused.

The Pico device uses for authentication purposes two buttons and a camera. The buttons are used for pairing and creating a new account. The authentication process is multi channel. It relies on a visual code created by the app in order to transmit its public key and unique id. The rest of the authentication process is performed over radio communication via nonce challenges to prove that the other participant has the private key corresponding to the public. The authentication protocol is described in detail in paper \cite{stajano2011pico}.

Authentication between the Pico device and its owner is performed using small devices called Picosiblings. These are meant to be embedded in everyday items that the owner carries around, such as earrings, rings, keys, chains, etc. Communication with the Picosiblings uses short range radio. The initialisation protocol for Picosiblings is called the resurecting ducklings \cite{stajano2000resurrecting}. Further enquiries are performed using picosibling pings once every predefined time interval. This tests whether the picosiblings are within the range of the Pico.

The communication between Pico and its Picosiblings is meant to reconstruct the Pico master key. Each Picosibling has a k-out-of-n secret used by the Pico device to reconstruct its master key. Pico tracks each Picosibling based on a timer. If the timer expires and the Picosibling is unable to generate a response, the secret is deleted. 

There are two special shares with a longer time out period: a biometric authentication mechanism, and a remote server communication. These are used for special cases such as having your Picosiblings and Pico both stolen. The biometric authentication would only allow the new user to have limited access time, while the remote server communication can be used to lock Pico remotely.
