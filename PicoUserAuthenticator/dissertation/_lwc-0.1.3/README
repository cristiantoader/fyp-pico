 LaTeX Word Counter works fine under Windows and Linux (I cannot try other systems ...) 

I Compilation (not needed if you downloaded only the lwc-'version'.zip
  -----------

Well, it's not very difficult. Just unzip the zip file ...
This is valid for both Linux and Windows.

Windows : use winzip or whatever other file decompressor
Linux   : use the command :
 unzip lwc-0.1.0.zip

If you want to modify the program and recompile it (you are encourage to do so), use the following commands to pack it in a jar file

Windows : double click on pack.bat (or run it in DOS command windows)
Linux   : run the pack script with the command :
 ./pack


II Use 
   ---

* Windows

 Just double click on the lwc.bat file (or run it in a DOS command window)

* Linux

 Run the script wordcount with the command :
  ./lwc

 Be sure that the file is executable.
 If not, use this command to change it :
  chmod 777 lwc


III Options
    -------

A log window is available. 
The user can see there the number of words per file or chapter/section following the option he chosed.
The user can also chose to count the title in the total of words (it can help when you feel short).

IV Restriction
   -----------

The actual version of the program suffers from a restriction.
This restriction is relevant for LaTeX files only.
We encounter this restriction in a special situation.

 * The option to count the words section by section has to be on;
 * The file has to include some \include commands

In this case, wich can occur on big reports, it is asked to one and only one chapter per included file.
If this condition is not respected, the result will errors in the log window. 
The total number of word will still be correct, but the number and names of the chapter will probably not be correct.
