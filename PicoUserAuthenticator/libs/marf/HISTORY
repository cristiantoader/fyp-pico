This project has started as a course project for Pattern Recognition,
Fall 2002, at Concordia University (http://www.concordia.ca/),
Dept. of Computer Science (http://www.cs.concordia.ca), Montreal, Canada,
by four students:

  Ian Clément
  Serguei Mokhov
  Dimitrios Nicolacopoulos
  Stephen Sinclair

The project seems to have survived past that school term,
and is being maintained by us.

There has been three official "releases" of our framework and
and SpeakerIdentApp so far.

        - More or less functional NeuralNet
        - "Random" feature extraction and classification
        - MahalanobisDistance, particular case for identity matrix
    - improved docs (a lot!)
    - code robustness via exceptions and 'final'

  SpeakerIdentApp, 0.2.0
    - Incorporates changes to MARF
