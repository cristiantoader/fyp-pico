MARF INSTALLATION
=================

NOTE: You will need at least JDK 1.3 installed and configured
to use MARF. If you have 1.3, then you will also need JAXP
extension (it's in the core of 1.4), you can download from
Sun's website: <http://java.sun.com>.

There are several ways to "install" MARF.

   - Download the latest marf-<ver>.jar
   - Build it from sources
     - UNIXen
     - Windows

Downloading the Latest marf-<ver>.jar
-------------------------------------

	Just go to <http://marf.sf.net>, and download marf-<ver>.jar
	from there.

	To install it, put the downloaded .jar file somewhere from within
	the reach of your CLASSPATH or java extensions directory, EXTDIRS.

	Et voila, since now on you can try to write some mini mind-blowing
	apps based on MARF. You can also get some demo applications,
	such as SpeakerIdentApp from the same exact web site
	to try out.


Building From Sources
---------------------

	You can grab the latest traball of the current CVS,
	or pre-packaged release from <http://marf.sf.net>
	and compile it yourself producing the .jar file, which
	you will need to install as described in the "Downloading
	the Lastest marf-<ver>.jar" section above.

UNIXen

	We went with the makefile build approach. You will need
	GNU make (sometimes called 'gmake') to use it. Assuming
	you have untarred and ungzipped the sources, 'cd' to
	/src and type:

	$ make

		Will compile and build marf-<ver>.jar in the current direcotry.

	$ make apidoc

		Will compile general API javadoc pages in "../../api"

	$ make apidoc-dev

		Will compile developer's API javadoc pages in "../../api-dev"

	Of course, you can compile w/o the makefile and use javac
	and jar directly if you really want to.

Windows

	We also used JBuilder 5 and 7, so there is a so-called project file
	marf.jpx in this directory. If you have JBuilder you can use
	this project file to build marf.jar; otherwise, you are stuck
	with javac/java/jar command-line tools for the moment.
