2003-01-25 16:00  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/: Classification.java,
	Distance/Distance.java, Markov/Markov.java,
	Stochastic/Stochastic.java: TrainingSet story is revisited again (a
	new update will come shortly as well)
	
	generic train() in Classification now implements some stuff for
	building TrainingSet if it's not there, hence this was removed from
	Distance. If derivatives plan to use mean vectors of the
	TrainingSet, they should call super.train() as their first thing in
	overridden train().
	
	If they also override dump()/restore(), they might need to do
	super.dump()/super.restore() depending on the module. 
	NeuralNetwork, for example does only super.train() in it's train()
	to bring in/update the training set, but dump()/restore() deal only
	with XML of the net itself.
	
	Filenames of the global clusters have changed to:
	
	marf.Storage.TrainingSet.<PR>.<FE>.<NOF>.[bin|csv]
	
	to differentiate between the same FE module but with different
	sizes of feature vectors, i.e. Number Of Features.

2003-01-25 15:52  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/NeuralNetwork/: NeuralNetwork.java,
	Neuron.java: A-believed-to-be-working NNet. Major fixes include
	removinf dump() in classification and moving commit() call inside
	for() in train(). The reason for the latter is that after eveyr
	subtraing interation weights were not kept, so the last trained
	subject was only committed... Other are mostly cos metical
	enhancements, as well as training stuff for TrainingSet is included
	--- super.traing() as for any other classification module.
	
	Do NOT try to run it against FFT of 1024.
	
	Will still need revisions, but I guess this is more or less final
	commit of the nnet for 0.2.0

	* src/marf/Storage/: Result.java, Sample.java, TrainingSet.java:
	Cosmetic/comment/debug fixes.  NOTE: More methods made final,
	including TrainingSet.	That leads to change of the on-disk format
	of the TrainingSet, so older versions of the class in the binary
	mode won't reload, and an exception will be thrown. This either
	requires a complete rertaining or don't compile this right now.

	- New module : RandomFE, which uses next pseudo random number from 
	 Gaussian distribution and mutliplies by the values in the incoming
	  vector; feature vector by default of 256 doubles. using htis one 
	 Distance classifiers had a stable max of 30 %, so this is our	
	physical mininmum for the real algos :-)

	* src/marf/Classification/: Distance/Distance.java,
	Distance/MahalanobisDistance.java,

	were wrong unless the speaker with the min distance was the   last
	in the training set :-( I descovered that in the output when   the
	second best for distance classifiers was 'Unknown' or 0
	
	- NNet has it's TrainingSet manipulations back as per recent

2003-01-12 15:35  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/Distance/: EuclideanDistance.java,

	But should be OK.

	* TODO, src/marf/util/MARFException.java: TODO update and
	MARFException to actually give us the error message.

2003-01-12 10:31  mokhov

	* src/marf/Preprocessing/FFTFilter/FFTFilter.java: A huge bug is
	fixed in FFTFIlter. freqResponse was declared static and so are
	methods using it. That would mean all instances of all filters in
	here running concurrently will mess with the exac same instance of
	frequency response array, which ain't good at all!

2003-01-12 10:27  mokhov

	* src/marf/FeatureExtraction/: FeatureExtraction.java,
	FFT/FFT.java, LPC/LPC.java, Segmentation/Segmentation.java: Mostly
	performance improvements and comsmetic commit: - new hamming() was
	added to actually apply hamming window	 to an array --- this
	avoids 1024 (default) hamming() calls	in FFT and 128 in LPC,
	instead we have ONE in both.	hamming will have to be moved one
	day to marf.util.math	 I guess along with some matrix
	manipulation when I get    to implement mahalanobis distance.  -
	few more methdos were made final - the rest is more cosmecit --
	comments and code-readability improvements

2003-01-12 09:58  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/NeuralNetwork/: NeuralNetwork.java,
	Neuron.java: My next passage over NNet: It made to work and run
	within the framework 'properly, but: with FFT it simply runs out of
	memory -- the net is to huge (in terms of links), and I haven't
	figured out a rationale on how many hidden layer and how many
	neuros should be in those layers.  For # of input neurons I take a
	size of a feature vector, and out put is 32, because 32 bits is an
	int size.
	
	It does work efficiently and not memrory consuming at all with LPC
	(hey, we;ve got only 20 coeffs. vs. 1024 of FFT!) but the end
	result as of now is that it recognized only the last subject it was
	trained on.
	
	Created generate(), a somewhat mimic'ing nnetgen.pl that takes # of
	neurons in layers and generates the net and the links in terms of
	data structures. It's initially called if the global cluster file
	is not there in initializ(), so we dump a new fresh one.
	
	Other than that, comments say it all, cleanups, more documentation,
	proper handling of the input params from app, etc.
	
	That epoch thing is still to be cleared out.

2003-01-12 09:48  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/: Markov/Markov.java,
	Stochastic/Stochastic.java: Cosmetic commits: - removed implements

	comments somehow (?!)

2003-01-12 09:45  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/Distance/Distance.java: Moved back in
	dump() in train() (see my previous commit, 1.47, to MARF) Removed
	'implements StorageManager' since Classification now has it

2003-01-12 09:42  mokhov

	* src/marf/MARF.java: OK, changes in MARF: - more methods made
	final - more correct handling of UNSET situation in train() - some
	rearrangements in restore() and train() (mostly cosmetic) -
	temporarily removed dump()/restore() calls in train() and moved  
	them down <classifier>.train() again, since we're not there yet  
	to avoid dump() on every training sample -- more thought required -
	added extra WaveGrapher dump past preprocessing, though I still  
	think the whole thing should be moved out from	 MARF

2003-01-10 02:28  mokhov

	* TODO, src/Makefile, src/marf/MARF.java,

	ways tatining sets are stored and mainpulated, local - store only

	set and implementing train() of distance classifiers in more proper
	way. Also the TrainingSet dump/restore mechanism will be rewritten
	to make it possible to have binary zipped file (our current
	training.set is 7Mb!) I will keep it still for DEBUG mode though.

	it, so I'd like to have Serguei & others go over the method I used
	to implement training before trying to make any more progress.
	
	My assumption is that training involves recording a bunch of
	feature vectors for various samples and writing them to the file. 
	It is acknowledged that "training" for the neural net requires
	another step, to train the net based on the collection of feature
	vectors.  Not quite sure that this is allowed for.  Please take a

	* src/marf/Storage/TrainingSet.java: 
	- stub, will be used for training, i.e. associating   speaker's ID
	with feature sets, I guess   per discussion with Ian

2002-12-05 14:28  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.java: - Ian,
	I fixed NN just to make it compile, please check the diff   of
	changes see if everything is correct. I had to add setInputs()	 as
	well
	
	- marf.jar, well since Jimmy added it, I updated it as well with  
	fresh sources

2002-12-04 10:49  iclement

	* src/marf/Classification/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.java: DEV:
	Added epoch training and binary output interpretation

2002-12-03 12:41  pwrslave

	* src/marf/Storage/Loaders/WAVLoader.java: Minor modification in
	constructor...

2002-12-02 02:18  pwrslave

	* src/marf/FeatureExtraction/: FFT/FFT.java, LPC/LPC.java: Minor
	touch ups...

2002-12-02 02:13  pwrslave

	* src/marf/Storage/: Sample.java, Wave.java, SampleLoader.java,
	Loaders/WAVLoader.java, ArtificialSample.java: Uncoupled
	SampleLoader and Sample...

2002-12-01 03:16  pwrslave

	* marf.jpx, marf.jpx.local: Includes marf archive...

2002-12-01 03:12  pwrslave

	* src/marf/Storage/SampleLoader.java: Added new method during
	debugging although not really needed at the end, but can be useful

2002-11-30 17:37  pwrslave

	* marf.jpx.local, marf.jpx: Project file used for JBuilder

2002-11-30 17:07  mokhov

	* src/marf/: MARF.java, Classification/Stochastic/Stochastic.java,
	Preprocessing/FFTFilter/BandpassFilter.java: MARF now includes and
	invokes all the modules, so few similar potential compile problems
	fixed in the unimplemented modules.

2002-11-30 16:47  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/Markov/Markov.java: This should solve the
	compile failures reported by Jimmy. Reason: since Markov class was
	never included or needed anywhere, it never got compiled from the
	command line. Perhaps I should change the build system somehow...

2002-11-25 02:43  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.java: making
	general MARF's API train() to work in NN.  see usage example in
	apps/TestNN

2002-11-25 02:01  mokhov

	* src/marf/Classification/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.java: - NN
	was made compilable within the framework   but requires lot more
	work

2002-11-25 01:49  mokhov

	* src/: Makefile, marf/FeatureExtraction/FeatureExtraction.java,
	marf/FeatureExtraction/LPC/LPC.java,

	marf/Storage/Loaders/ULAWLoader.java,
	marf/Storage/Loaders/WAVLoader.java,
	marf/util/InvalidSampleFormatException.java: Mostly work on
	Storage:   - Wave sample class	 - WAVLoader   - Generic
	SampleLoader Basically Jimmy's stuff was split accross these all
	Sample was also affected so was ArtificialSample' to reflect mthod
	signature changes hamming thing was also move into
	FeatureExtraction as static part.  Makefile now produces marf.jar
	if yo upoint your class path to it or copy to your jre/lib/ext dir
	for it to become visible to use for apps.

2002-11-24 11:16  mokhov

	* src/marf/: MARF.java,
	Classification/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.java,
	FeatureExtraction/LPC/LPC.java, Storage/ModuleParams.java: - LPC is
	believed to be more or less frameworked --- still need to port	
	the testing app, but that requires porting Wave stuff first :-) -
	New addition: ModuleParams - a collection of Vectors, a Vector	
	per module. An app can sepcify module specific params, put   into
	the corresponding Vectors, init MARF and etc. The module   should
	know how to extract and downcast params from these vectors   See
	constructor of LPC for example. The app will follow.  - MARF has
	been altered to accomodate ModuleParams addition.

	marf/Storage/ArtificialSample.java, marf/Storage/Sample.java:
	Mostly feature extraction, FFT in particular: - Made fully
	dunctional FFT - FeatureExtractionExcpetion (analogous to that of
	Classificayion) - Few changes nad dummy things to test FFT - an app
	was made to work with the frameworked FFT!

2002-11-23 18:26  mokhov

	marf/Storage/Result.java: The framework made compile at the
	following price: - Need to work a bit on NN stuff, right now it's  
	commented out.
	
	Other changes include: - make install will now "install" the
	framework   into the speaker ident app dir - a kludge	but makes
	the app to compile--- will be extended soon - Result object has
	more stuff in it - Few fixes in MARF where LpC was listed in thre
	classif.    section  - Others
	
	Aftre this commit it is compilable by make in /src

2002-11-17 20:19  iclement

	* src/marf/FeatureExtraction/LPC/LPC.java: DEV: Filled in with LPC
	code from /rescources/LPC. Should work, but will need testing in
