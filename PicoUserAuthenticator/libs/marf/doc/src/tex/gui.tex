\section{GUI}

Even though this section is entitled as GUI, we don't
really have any actual GUI yet (it's planned though,
see TODO, \ref{appx:todo}). We do have a couple
of things under the \verb+marf.gui+ package, which we do
occasionaly use and evetually they will expand to be a real
GUI classes. This tiny package is in Figure \ref{fig:gui}.
