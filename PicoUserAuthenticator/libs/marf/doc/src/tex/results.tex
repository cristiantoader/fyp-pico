\subsection{Notes}

Before we get to numbers, few notes and observations first:

\begin{enumerate}

\item We've got more samples since the demo. The obvious: by increasing the number of samples our results got
      better; with few exceptions, however. This can be explained by
      the diversity of the recording equipment, a lot less than uniform
      number of samples per speaker, and absence of noise and silence
      removal. All the samples were recorded in not the same environments.
      The results then start averaging after awhile.

\item Another observation we made from our output, is that
      when the speaker is guessed incorrectly, quite often the second
      guess is correct, so we included this in our results as if we were
      ``guessing'' right from the second attempt.

\item FUN. Interesting to note, that we also tried to take some
      samples of music bands, and feed it to our application
      along with the speakers, and application's performance didn't suffer,
      yet even improved because the samples were treated in
      the same manner. The groups were not mentioned in the table,
      so we name them here: Van Halen [8:1] and Red Hot Chili Peppers [10:1] (where numbers
      represent [training:testing] samples used).

\subsection{Configuration Explained}

Configuration parameters were exracted from the command line
which SpeakerIdentApp was invoked with. They mean the following:

\begin{verbatim}
Usage:
    java SpeakerIdentApp --train <samples-dir> [options]  -- train mode
                         --ident <sample> [options]       -- identification mode
                         --stats                          -- display stats
                         --reset                          -- reset stats
                         --version                        -- display version info
                         --help                           -- display this help and exit

Options (one or more of the following):

Preprocessing:

  -norm         - use just normalization, no filtering
  -low          - use low pass filter
  -high         - use high pass filter
  -boost        - use high frequency boost filter
  -band         - use bandpass filter

Feature Extraction:

  -lpc          - use LPC
  -fft          - use FFT
  -randfe       - use random feature extraction

Classification:

  -nn           - use Neural Network
  -cheb         - use Chebyshev Distance
  -eucl         - use Euclidean Distance
  -mink         - use Minkowski Distance
  -randcl       - use random classification

Misc:

  -debug        - include verbose debug output
  -spectrogram  - dump spectrogram image after feature extraction
  -graph        - dump wave graph before preprocessing and after feature extraction
  <integer>     - expected speaker ID

\subsection{Consolidated Results}

Our ultimate results \footnote{as of \input{date}} for all configurations we can have
and samples we've got are in the Table \ref{tab:results}.
Looks like our best results are with
``-norm -fft -cheb'',
``-norm -fft -eucl'',
``-norm -fft -mah'',
``-high -fft -eucl'',
``-high -fft -mah'' and,
``-high -fft -mink''
with the top result being 80\%.
