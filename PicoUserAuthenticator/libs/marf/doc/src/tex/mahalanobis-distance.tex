\subsubsection{Mahalanobis Distance}\label{sect:mahalanobis}

This distance classification is meant to be able to detect features
that tend to vary together in the same cluster if linear
transformations are applied to them, so it becomes invariant
from these transformations unlike all the other, previously seen
distance classifiers.

$$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x-y) C^{-1} (x-y)^{T}} $$

\noindent
where $x$ and $y$ are feature vectors of the same length $n$, and
$C$ is a covariance matrix, learnt during training for co-related
features.

In this release, namely 0.2.0, it's not implemented yet, only with
the covariance matrix being an identity matrix, $ C = I $,
making Mahalanobis distance be the same as the Euclidean one. We plan
to have it fully implemented in the next release, when we
decide how we go about matrix/vector operations in MARF.
