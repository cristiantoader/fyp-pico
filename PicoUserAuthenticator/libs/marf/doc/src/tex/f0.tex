F0 (the fundamental frequency, or "pitch").
The text doesn't go into too much detail but gives a few techniques. Most
seem to involve another preprocesing to remove high frequencies and then
some estimation and postprocessing correction. Another, more detailed
source may be needed.

Another consideration will be window. The obvious one is:

$r(t) = 1 for 0 <= t <= N-1
     = 0 otherwise$

\par
But supposedly the Hamming window is better:

$h(t) = 0.54 - 0.46 cos((2*pi*t)/(N-1)) for 0 <= t <= N-1
     = 0 otherwise$

\par
N is length of window. From the text, for LPC extraction N should be
between 20-30ms.
