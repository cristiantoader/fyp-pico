\subsection{Wave Grapher}

\verb+WaveGrapher+ is another class designed, as the name
suggests, to draw the wave form of the incoming/preprocessed
signal. Well, it doen't actually draw a thing, but dumps
the sample points into a tab-delimited text file to be loaded
into some plotting software, such as \verb+gnuplot+ or Excel. We also
use it to produce graphs of the signal in the frequency domain
istead of time domain. Examples of the graphs of data obtained
via this class are in the Preprocessing Section (\ref{sect:preprocessing}).
